      "Writing code you might soon get into a situation where you cannot easily test all code because of a not given environment where you can use it. **While unittesting you should not connect to a database, to web services and avoid OS operations**; that's more a topic for regression tests. Writing regressions tests and installing and configuring a test system are another story.\n",

I just wonder why that has not been done more easy with standard interface \"assert_whatever(param1, .., paramn)\".
